In this episode, the podcast looks back on 10 years of U.S.-China diplomacy following the postponement of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s planned visit to China in early 2023.</p><p>The China in the World podcast has spanned three U.S. administrations and covered several historic bilateral meetings, from Barack Obama and Xi Jinping’s summit in Sunnylands, California in June 2013 to Donald Trump and Xi’s meeting at Mar-a-Lago in April 2017. This episode gives a glimpse into the evolution of U.S.-China relations during a pivotal decade and sheds light on what can be accomplished during high-level meetings—what went right and what went wrong during past meetings.</p><p>The episode features clips from Paul Haenle’s interviews with over 20 American, Chinese, and international experts on foreign affairs.<span class="cube"></span></p>  </div>  </div>
