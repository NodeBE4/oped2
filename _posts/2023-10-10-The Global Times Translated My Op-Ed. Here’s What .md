The article was subsequently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230602042419/https:/oversea.huanqiu.com/article/4D2n6lR5fAe" target="_blank">translated</a> by the Chinese State-run <em>Global Times</em> newspaper without my prior knowledge or permission, appearing both in print and digital forms.</p><p>The <em>Global Times</em> omitted and altered key parts of the essay. While a few of the changes simply shorten the piece or cut passages that might not be as interesting to Chinese readers, most of the deletions and changes eliminate or blunt criticism of China, altering the tone of the essay. The <em>Global Times</em> also removed all of the links that appeared in my article, presumably because at least some of them led to sites that are generally inaccessible within China.</p><p>Fortunately, <em>The New York Times</em> also did a complete Chinese translation in both <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/opinion/20230526/china-usa-scientists-technology/" target="_blank">simplified</a> and <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/opinion/20230526/china-usa-scientists-technology/zh-hant/" target="_blank">traditional</a> characters.</p><p>Below, I offer an annotated English version of the original essay with notes on the changes the <em>Global Times</em> made in its Chinese translation. Language the <em>Global Times</em> did not translate is <span class="cf-hl-purple">highlighted in purple</span>; sections that were notably altered are in yellow, with annotated notes you can click on to read.</p><p>Presumably because of requests from <em>The New York Times</em>, the <em>Global Times</em> translation of the article was taken down from the Internet. However, documenting differences between the original and the <em>Global Times</em> translation can help us to understand what Chinese censors might find acceptable, although the standard of what can be published certainly changes over time and in different contexts.</p><hr><h2>Like It or Not, America Needs Chinese Scientists</h2><p><strong>May 25, 2023</strong></p><p><strong>By Dan Murphy</strong></p><p><span class="cf-hl-purple">Mr. Murphy has been involved in fostering academic links with China for more than two decades.</span></p><p><span class="cf-hl-purple">The Chinese Communist Party has accomplished something rare in U.S. politics these days: uniting Democrats and Republicans around a common enemy.</span></p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-mike-gallagher-china-business-e9e4d4c5617bb1cd2ab237fd86f2fc6b" target="_blank">frenzied concern</a> about Chinese influence threatens America’s ability to attract the top talent it needs to maintain global leadership in science and higher education.</p><p>The damage caused by the Department of Justice’s now-disbanded <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/nsd/information-about-department-justice-s-china-initiative-and-compilation-china-related" target="_blank">China Initiative</a> still reverberates. <span class="cf-hl-purple">Designed to counter economic espionage and national security threats from China, it resulted—in some cases—in researchers and academics of Chinese descent being placed under <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/education/2022/02/24/university-tennessee-professor-anming-hu-career-after-china-initiative-charges/6829244001/" target="_blank">house arrest</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/24/science/gang-chen-mit-china.html" target="_blank">taken away in handcuffs</a> on charges of hiding ties to China, cases that ended in acquittal or were later dropped.</span></p><p><span class="cf-hl-purple">The program resulted in few prosecutions before being shut down last year.</span> But it upended lives and careers, and created an atmosphere of fear. Some ethnic Chinese scientists <a href="https://www.committee100.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/C100-Lee-Li-White-Paper-FINAL-FINAL-10.28.pdf" target="_blank">disproportionately feel</a> that their ethnicity and connections to China inhibit their professional progress and their chances of obtaining<span class="cf-hl-purple">—and willingness to apply for—</span>research funding in the United States. A <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2209/2209.10642.pdf" target="_blank">survey of scientists</a> of Chinese descent at American universities released last year found that significant percentages of respondents felt unwelcome in the United States, with 86 percent saying the current climate makes it more difficult for the United States to attract top international students than it was five years ago.</p><p>This should be setting off alarm bells in Washington. Economic and military advantage is <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/eric-schmidt-innovation-power-technology-geopolitics" target="_blank">contingent on superior science, technology and innovation</a>—and the competition for talent is global.</p><p>Studies <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/497557a" target="_blank">show</a> that the best science is often done by international research teams, presumably because researchers can select from a broader range of potential partners. When we discourage international collaboration in the absence of clear concerns about national security, we limit the pool of possible collaborators, potentially weakening the research.</p><p>This is especially true when it comes to China, which has become a scientific power.</p><p>China was second only to the United States in total spending on <a href="https://data.oecd.org/rd/gross-domestic-spending-on-r-d.htm" target="_blank">research and development</a> as of 2018, according to figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Chinese publishing of research papers <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37372501/Stumbling%20bear%20soaring%20dragon.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y" target="_blank">has grown</a>, by one measure, to 25 percent in 2020 from less than 1 percent of the global total before 1990.</p><p>This work is of increasingly high quality. <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/china-rises-first-place-most-cited-papers" target="_blank">According to some calculations</a>, Chinese papers are cited (an indication of a paper’s impact) by academics in their own work more often than those of any other country. Academics also choose their partners based on who can best help them to advance their work, and researchers at American universities have for years chosen co-authors from China more than from any other country, according to a <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20214/international-collaboration-and-citations" target="_blank">report</a> from the National Science Foundation. <span class="cf-hl-purple">Questions have been raised about Chinese <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/world/asia/china-science-fraud-scandals.html" target="_blank">academic fraud</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/32440f74-7804-4637-a662-6cdc8f3fba86" target="_blank">low-quality patents</a>, but more work is needed to assess how widespread those problems are.</span></p><p>Concerns over academic collaboration with China are legitimate. <span class="cf-hl-purple">Under the <a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/myths-and-realities-of-chinas-military-civil-fusion-strategy" target="_blank">Chinese model</a>, civilian organizations and businesses are sometimes obliged to support the country’s military apparatus. I’ve <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/07/chinas-long-arm-reaches-into-american-campuses-chinese-students-scholars-association-university-communist-party/" target="_blank">heard</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/2020/12/08/china-spy-california-politicians" target="_blank">enough</a> to believe that some Chinese students in America may be reporting what happens in class to agents in China and that some Chinese scholars may have undisclosed agreements to relay what they have learned back home.</span></p><p><span class="cf-hl-purple">China’s government has contributed to the deterioration of academic cooperation. Conducting research in China is harder than it has been in years because of an increased emphasis there on ideology and national security, an ever-widening scope of topics deemed sensitive, decreasing academic freedom and, until they were ended last December, the smothering effect of nearly three years of zero-Covid policies.</span></p><p>But let’s not race China to the bottom. If America fails to attract top international research talent, that harms U.S. prospects for scientific advancement and, ultimately, American economic and national strength.</p><p><span class="cf-hl-purple">There is no doubt that present circumstances call for more transparency among scholars. Universities need to lead this change, whereby scholars pay greater attention to the implications of collaborating with foreign scientists. For example, Sweden has developed <a href="https://www.stint.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/STINT__Responsible_Internationalisation.pdf" target="_blank">frameworks</a> for assessing risks through more structured due diligence of research partners, including assessing complications that might arise when collaborating with scientists from authoritarian countries.</span></p><p><span class="cf-hl-purple">But we can’t let this get in the way of ensuring that the United States <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/16/immigration-us-technology-companies-work-visas-china-talent-competition-universities/" target="_blank">remains the best place</a> in the world to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics and entices graduates from abroad to remain here after completing their degrees.</span> Yet the number of U.S. visas granted to Chinese students has <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/number-of-new-chinese-students-at-u-s-colleges-plummeted-this-fall-visa-data-show" target="_blank">plummeted</a>. To reverse this, visa processes should be streamlined, backlogs cleared and talented individuals given expanded opportunities to obtain green cards. <span class="cf-hl-purple">America is training and educating some of the world’s brightest people; we need to get more of them and keep them here.</span></p><p><span class="cf-hl-purple">Likewise, more Americans need to be learning about China. The number of American students studying in China was already <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-students-love-affair-with-china-cools-as-political-tensions-rise-11610802000?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">declining</a> from a peak of about 15,000 in 2011-12; during the pandemic that <a href="https://opendoorsdata.org/fact_sheets/china/" target="_blank">plummeted</a> to less than 400. China is, and will continue to be, a critical global player; understanding its internal dynamics will be important for people operating in a range of fields. Yet we are at risk of having an entire generation of Americans who know little about China.</span></p><p>We should immediately <a href="https://larsen.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2741#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20D.C.%20%E2%80%93%20Today%2C%20Reps,from%20China%20and%20Hong%20Kong." target="_blank">restart the Fulbright program</a> in China, which sent thousands of Chinese and Americans between the two countries for research and learning until it was halted during the Trump administration, and increase federal funding for Chinese studies programs at our universities.</p><p>Keeping American higher education open to the world is not about helping China to become strong, <span class="cf-hl-purple">nor should we delude ourselves about Beijing’s intentions.</span> It’s about exuding confidence in the strength and virtues of our system to ensure that America remains the best country in the world for learning and research.</p><p><span class="cf-hl-purple"><a title="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/about/staff/dan-murphy" href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/about/staff/dan-murphy" target="_blank">Dan Murphy</a> is executive director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School and former executive director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard.</span><span class="cube"></span></p>  </div>  </div>
