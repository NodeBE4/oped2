In May, China’s Special Representative for Eurasian Affairs, Li Hui, traveled <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3222450/chinese-envoys-europe-trip-search-common-ground-ukraine-war-analysts-say" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">throughout European capitals</a> to discuss the potential for a “political settlement” of the Ukraine crisis. Meanwhile, Kiev has launched a counteroffensive in five areas along the front in Donetsk. In the background, China-Russia diplomatic, economic, and military relations remain robust. How is the Ukraine war impacting China-Russia relations? Are there limits to the China-Russia partnership? Will relations between Moscow and Beijing grow more or less asymmetrical in the years to come?</p><p>This China in the World podcast was recorded as a live Twitter Spaces discussion featuring Alexander Gabuev, Amy Chew, and Paul Haenle on the state of the Ukraine War and China-Russia relations. It was recorded on June 14, before the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wagner-groups-rebellion-putin-unfolded/story?id=100373557" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagner Group rebellion</a> took place.<span class="cube"></span></p>  </div>  </div>
