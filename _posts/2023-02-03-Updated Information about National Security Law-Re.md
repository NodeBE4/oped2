<div class="content">    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">      <p>We’ve just updated our suite of graphics <a href="https://www.chinafile.com/tracking-impact-of-hong-kongs-national-security-law" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tracking the impact of Hong Kong’s National Security Law</a>. It now includes information on the 227 individuals arrested between July 2020, when the law went into effect, and the end of 2022. Information on these individuals’ cases, compiled by our partners at the Georgetown <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/law-asia/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Center for Asian Law</a>, includes grounds for arrest, and, where applicable, resulting charges and convictions.</p><p>This most recent update includes seven new arrests and more than a dozen new convictions—including the conviction (currently under appeal) of nonagenarian Cardinal Joseph Zen, whom the Hong Kong National Security Department arrested for “failing to register under the Societies Ordinance.”</p>  </div>  </div>
