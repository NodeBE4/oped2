<div class="content">    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">      <p>For the last few years, ChinaFile has collected and hosted the list of official names of all the places (political units) in China. This information is openly available on the Chinese government’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) website, but not in an easily downloadable or searchable format. We have compiled these lists in CSV format, available <a href="https://chinafile.com/node/52566" rel="nofollow">here</a>, in the hopes they may be of use to other researchers.</p>  </div>  </div>
