<div class="content">    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">      <p>Last week, frequent ChinaFile contributors <a href="https://www.chinafile.com/contributors/geremie-r-barme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Geremie Barmé</a> and <a href="https://www.chinafile.com/contributors/zha-jianying" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zha Jianying</a> joined editor Susan Jakes on Twitter Spaces to discus Zha’s recent short story for ChinaFile, “<a href="https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/features/prize-student" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Prize Student</a>.” The story takes place in Nanjing in 1983, as a prominent writer pays a visit to a Middle School teacher he had denounced and persecuted at the start of the Cultural Revolution 17 years earlier. Bamé and Zha discussed the story’s origins, their own experience of the Cultural Revolution, and the vexed question of how it is and can be remembered in China today. You can listen to the conversation, the first of what we are calling “Conversations with ChinaFile” <a href="https://t.co/5w8FukUb9F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  </div>  </div>
