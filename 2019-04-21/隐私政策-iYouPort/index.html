     Activity 
    
    
     
      This feature only records activities of a site’s registered users, and the retention duration of activity data will depend on the site’s plan and activity type.
     
    
   
    
    Data Used:
    To deliver this functionality and record activities around site management, the following information is captured: user email address, user role, user login, user display name, WordPress.com and local user IDs, the activity to be recorded, the WordPress.com-connected site ID of the site on which the activity takes place, the site’s Jetpack version, and the timestamp of the activity. Some activities may also include the actor’s IP address (login attempts, for example) and user agent.
    
    Activity Tracked:
    Login attempts/actions, post and page update and publish actions, comment/pingback submission and management actions, plugin and theme management actions, widget updates, user management actions, and the modification of other various site settings and options. Retention duration of activity data depends on the site’s plan and activity type.  See the complete list of currently-recorded activities (along with retention information)  .
    
    Data Synced (
    
     ?
    
    ):

     Ads 
    
    
     
      This feature is only available to sites on the Premium and Professional plans.
     
    
   
    
    Data Used:
    The following information (made available from the visitor’s browser) is collected and sent to Automattic’s Demand Partners: IP address, geographical data (derived from the IP address), user agent, operating system, device type, unique user ID (randomly generated identifier), current URL, and IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) interest category. Log data (IP address, geographical data, user agent, operating system, device type) is stored for 30 days. The unique user ID is stored in cookies and is retained for 1 year.
    
    Activity Tracked:
    Ad impressions, video-related events (i.e. pause, mute, 100% plays, etc.) or errors, and ad click events. Various cookies are used for the following purposes: delivering targeted advertisements to specific visitors, storing user identifiers, and collecting anonymous ad platform stats.
    
     Carousel 
    
    
     
      Image views are only recorded if the site owner, has explicitly enabled image view stats tracking for this feature via the
      
       jetpack_enable_carousel_stats
      
      filter.
     
    
   
    
    Data Used:

    If  Akismet  is enabled on the site, the contact form submission data — IP address, user agent, name, email address, website, and message — is submitted to the  Akismet  service (also owned by  Automattic  ) for the sole purpose of spam checking. The actual submission data is stored in the database of the site on which it was submitted and is emailed directly to the owner of the form (i.e. the site author who published the page on which the contact form resides). This email will include the submitter’s IP address, timestamp, name, email address, website, and message.
    
    Data Synced (
    
     ?
    
    ):

Google Analytics does offer  IP anonymization  , which can be enabled by the site owner.
    
    Activity Tracked:
    This feature sends page view events (and potentially  video play events  ) over to Google Analytics for consumption. For sites running WooCommerce-powered stores, some additional events are also sent to Google Analytics: shopping cart additions and removals, product listing views and clicks, product detail views, and purchases. Tracking for each specific WooCommerce event needs to be enabled by the site owner.

    Activity Tracked:
    Page views will be tracked with each additional load (i.e. when you scroll down to the bottom of the page and a new set of posts loads automatically).

     Contact Form 
    
    Data Used:
    If  Akismet  is enabled on the site, the contact form submission data — IP address, user agent, name, email address, website, and message — is submitted to the  Akismet  service (also owned by  Automattic  ) for the sole purpose of spam checking. The actual submission data is stored in the database of the site on which it was submitted and is emailed directly to the owner of the form (i.e. the site author who published the page on which the contact form resides). This email will include the submitter’s IP address, timestamp, name, email address, website, and message.
    
    Data Synced (
    
     ?

For sites running  WooCommerce  (also owned by  Automattic  ) and this feature simultaneously and having all purchase tracking explicitly enabled, purchase events will send Google Analytics the following information: order number, product id and name, product category, total cost, and quantity of items purchased. Google Analytics does offer  IP anonymization  , which can be enabled by the site owner.
    
    Activity Tracked:
    This feature sends page view events (and potentially  video play events  ) over to Google Analytics for consumption. For sites running WooCommerce-powered stores, some additional events are also sent to Google Analytics: shopping cart additions and removals, product listing views and clicks, product detail views, and purchases. Tracking for each specific WooCommerce event needs to be enabled by the site owner.
    
     Gravatar Hovercards 
    
    Data Used:

    <p><strong>
    Data Used:
   </strong> Please refer to the appropriate <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsTrackingOverview#howAnalyticsGetsData"> Google Analytics documentation </a> for the specific type of data it collects. For sites running <a href="https://woocommerce.com/"> WooCommerce </a> (also owned by <a href="https://automattic.com/"> Automattic </a> ) and this feature simultaneously and having all purchase tracking explicitly enabled, purchase events will send Google Analytics the following information: order number, product id and name, product category, total cost, and quantity of items purchased. Google Analytics does offer <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en"> IP anonymization </a> , which can be enabled by the site owner.</p>
    <p><strong>
    Activity Tracked:
   </strong> This feature sends page view events (and potentially <a href="https://jetpackme.wordpress.com/support/for-your-privacy-policy/#video-hosting"> video play events </a> ) over to Google Analytics for consumption. For sites running WooCommerce-powered stores, some additional events are also sent to Google Analytics: shopping cart additions and removals, product listing views and clicks, product detail views, and purchases. Tracking for each specific WooCommerce event needs to be enabled by the site owner.</p>

    <p><strong>
    Activity Tracked:
   </strong> Page views will be tracked with each additional load (i.e. when you scroll down to the bottom of the page and a new set of posts loads automatically).
